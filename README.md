# ssb / meilisearch

very small ssb -> meilisearch experiment, because searching in Patchwork / Patchbay always pisses me off.

## install / use
1. install meilisearch (https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/introduction/quick_start_guide.html)
1. run it (`./meilisearch`)
1. clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/stripedpajamas/ssb-meili`)
1. cd into it (`cd ssb-meili`)
1. install deps (`npm install`)
1. run it (`npm start`)

it will produce a lot of output :D

currently this is more of a single run utility; if you run it twice it does all the work again.

when it's done, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:7700 and instant-search through SSB posts :)
